**CS 386 NAU Fall 2020**

* Software engineering is the topic.  What's that mean?  We'll discuss at length.

* Instructor: Alex Groce (SICCS/Building 90 Room 208 - alex.groce@nau.edu)

* Catalog description: "Involves applying software engineering and software architecture principles and techniques in the construction of complex computer programs in a team setting. Individualized and team writing and oral presentation tasks. Ethical issues."

* [Textbook](./textbook): "Building Secure & Reliable Systems: Best Practices for Designing, Implementing and Maintaining Systems", Heather Adkins, Betsy Beyer, Paul Blankinship, Ana Oprea, Piotr Lewandowski, and Adam Stubblefield.  It's free, see the linked directory.  This is basically a book on Google's experiences building high-reliability, highly secure, software systems, at  extreme (planetary?) scale, and with a sea of adversaries.

* Course note:  This is going to be a bit of an unconventional SE class, because I'm teaching it, and I have some different opinions on how to start things going with SE.
